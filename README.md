# __DIDLYDOO-APP__

This exercice consists of creating an app that permit to peoples to0 add their disponibilities and pick a specific date for an event.
We have worked as a team with the collaboration of Anthony Denayer and Noa Cayphas.
------
## __Method:__

We're using a backend doc regrouping json files and a server that we can access with node.js to work with all the data we need.
The index.mjs file is used to store new data in an array of events, it contains already some events with many objects: the name, the date, the description, the author and several due dates and many attendees, as for their availibility.

For storing new data with an input and access those already stored, we use promises and several fetch methods: Get, Post, Patch, Delete to treat everything. This is used as our first alternative to localstorage.
